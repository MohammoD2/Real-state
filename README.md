Real state
==============================

Our Real Estate Analysis and Prediction Project offers a comprehensive suite of tools tailored for the dynamic market of Gulshan, Bangladesh. The Analytics Module provides in-depth insights with features such as Spatial Analysis, which visualizes the geographical distribution of properties to identify high-demand areas, and Price Distribution across Sectors, which breaks down property values in different parts of Gulshan. The Price vs. Square Foot Analysis examines the relationship between property prices and their sizes, helping users assess value for money. The Number of Rooms Pie Chart offers a visual representation of market composition based on property sizes, while the Top Feature Word Cloud highlights the most sought-after amenities, guiding developers to focus on desirable attributes.The Price Prediction Module utilizes machine learning algorithms to forecast property prices based on historical data and property attributes, aiding investors in estimating future market trends. The Recommender System Module enhances user experience by personalizing property suggestions based on user preferences and past interactions. By leveraging these advanced analytical tools, our project aims to deliver a robust, data-driven approach to real estate analysis and decision-making in the Gulshan area, ensuring informed and strategic investments.
